<h1>The Best Movies According to Felicia</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Purple Rain</h3>
<p>I love this movie for multiple reasons. Firstly, 
    Prince is my favorite musical artist of ALL TIME!</p>
<h3>The Gentleman</h3>
<p>I think Guy Ritchie is one of the best directors of 
    action movies and this one does not disappoint.</p>
<h3>The Departed</h3>
<p>Leonard DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors and 
    add in Martin Scorscese, you've got a smash! 
    I won't spoil the ending for you...but its a doozy!</p>
